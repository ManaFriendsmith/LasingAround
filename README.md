# DEPENDENCIES

There are two ways to control the difficulty: a global setting that's part of pf-functions (increases the **depth** of the crafting tree) and adding more mods (increases the **breadth** of the crafting tree). Any combination of these mods should work; please report if there is an error or a softlock.
